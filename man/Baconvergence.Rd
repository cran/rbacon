\title{Test to identify poorly mixed MCMC runs.}
\usage{
Baconvergence(core = "MSB2K", set = get("info"), runs = 5, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{core}{Name of the core, given using quotes. Defaults to one of the cores provided with rbacon, \code{core="MSB2K"}.}

\item{set}{Detailed information of the current run, stored within this session's memory as variable \code{info}.}

\item{runs}{Amount of runs to test for mixing. Default \code{runs=5}.}

\item{...}{additional options that can be given to the Bacon function.}
}
\value{
NA
}
\description{
Test how well-mixed and converged the MCMC runs are with the chosen core and settings, by running the core several times and comparing the different runs using the Gelman and Rubin Reduction factor (Brooks and Gelman, 1998).
}
\details{
Generally Bacon will perform millions of MCMC iterations for each age-model run, although only a fraction 
of these will be stored. In most cases the remaining MCMC iterations will be well mixed (the upper left panel 
of the fit of the iterations shows no strange features such as sudden systematic drops or rises).
 However if the iterations seem not well mixed, or if too few remain (say less than a few hundred), 
 then you could check the Gelman and Rubin Reduction Factor. Too high differences (high Factors) between runs 
indicate poor MCMC mixing. Robust MCMC mixing is indicated by a Gelman and Rubin Reduction factor 
(Brooks and Gelman, 1998) below the 1.05 safety threshold.
