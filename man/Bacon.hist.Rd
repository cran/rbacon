\title{Calculate age distributions of depths.}
\usage{
Bacon.hist(
  d,
  set = get("info"),
  BCAD = set$BCAD,
  age.lab = c(),
  age.lim = c(),
  hist.lab = "Frequency",
  calc.range = TRUE,
  hist.lim = c(),
  draw = TRUE,
  prob = set$prob,
  hist.col = grey(0.5),
  hist.border = grey(0.2),
  range.col = "blue",
  med.col = "green",
  mean.col = "red",
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{d}{The depth or depths for which a histogram and age ranges should be provided. If multiple depths are given, then just the age ranges, median and means (no graphs) are provided for each depth.}

\item{set}{Detailed information of the current run, stored within this session's memory as variable info.}

\item{BCAD}{The calendar scale of graphs and age output-files is in \code{cal BP} by default, but can be changed to BC/AD using \code{BCAD=TRUE}.}

\item{age.lab}{The labels for the calendar axis (default \code{age.lab="cal BP"} or \code{"BC/AD"} if \code{BCAD=TRUE}).}

\item{age.lim}{Minimum and maximum calendar age ranges, calculated automatically by default (\code{age.lim=c()}).}

\item{hist.lab}{The y-axis is labelled \code{ylab="Frequency"} by default.}

\item{calc.range}{Calculate ranges? Takes time so can be left out}

\item{hist.lim}{Limits of the y-axis.}

\item{draw}{Draw a plot or not. Defaults to \code{draw=TRUE}, however no plots are made if more than one depth \code{d} is provided.
If \code{draw=FALSE}, then the age ranges, median and mean are given for each depth (as four columns).}

\item{prob}{Age ranges are given as quantiles, e.g., 2.5\% and 97.5\% for the default of 95\% confidence limits (\code{prob=0.95})).}

\item{hist.col}{Colour of the histogram. Default grey, \code{hist.col=grey(0.5)}.}

\item{hist.border}{Colour of the histogram's outline. Default dark grey, \code{hist.border=grey(0.2)}.}

\item{range.col}{Colour of confidence ranges. Defaults to \code{range.col="blue"}.}

\item{med.col}{Colour of the median. Defaults to \code{med.col="green"}.}

\item{mean.col}{Colour of the mean. Defaults to \code{mn.col="red"}.}

\item{verbose}{Provide feedback on what is happening (default \code{verbose=TRUE}).}
}
\value{
A plot with the histogram and the age ranges, median and mean, or just the age ranges, medians and means if more than one depth \code{d} is given.
}
\description{
Calculate the distribution of age estimates of single or multiple depths.
}
\details{
Age estimates of specific depths can also be plotted.
