\title{Provide a summary of the estimated accumulation rates for any age of a core.}
\usage{
accrate.age.summary(
  age,
  set = get("info"),
  cmyr = FALSE,
  na.rm = TRUE,
  probs = c(0.025, 0.16, 0.84, 0.975, 0.5)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{age}{The age for which accumulation rates need to be returned.}

\item{set}{Detailed information of the current run, stored within this session's memory as variable \code{info}.}

\item{cmyr}{Accumulation rates can be calculated in cm/year or year/cm. By default \code{cmyr=FALSE} and accumulation rates are calculated in year per cm.}

\item{na.rm}{Remove NA entries. These are NOT removed by default, so that always the same amount of iterations is returned.}

\item{probs}{The probability ranges to be returned. Defaults to the minima and maxima of the 95\% and 68\% ranges, as well as the median: \code{probs=c(.025, .16, .84, .975, .5)}.}
}
\value{
A summary of the estimated accumulation rate of the chosen depth: minimum of the 95\% interval, minimum of the 68\% interval, maximum of the 68\% interval, maximum of the 95\% interval, median (i.e., 50\%) and mean.
}
\description{
Obtain a summary (95\% range, 68\% range, median, mean) of the accumulation rates (in years per cm, so actually sedimentation times) as estimated by the MCMC iterations for any age of a core.
}
