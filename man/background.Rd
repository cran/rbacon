\title{calculate probabilities that Pb-210 data have reached background levels}
\usage{
background(set = get("info"), Al = set$Al)
}
\arguments{
\item{set}{Detailed information of the current run, stored within this session's memory as variable \code{info}.}

\item{Al}{The detection limit. Default \code{Al=0.1}.}
}
\value{
a list of probabilities for each Pb-210 data point
}
\description{
Checks which of the Pb-210 data most likely have reached background levels and thus are below the detection limit Al (probabilities between 0 and 1)
